- kafka don't support rabbit mq's TTL, need to add a config for kafka in OMS's cancel TTL order and return request TTL rejection
  The workaround is to use Kafka's topic(queue) retention policies.
  Main consumer will check if the message expiration is up, if it's up then it will be process as normal. or else send
  off message to delayed topic. The delayed topic will have a scheduled delayed consumer to consume from topic.
  Delayed Consumer will check/consume from delayed topic, with default consume amount of 500, max.poll.records = 500.
  So to put this delayed consumer on Spring task to consume a max or 500 message a minute, when message expiration is up,
  it will be sent off back to main topic and main consumer will process as normal.

  This will introduce more complexity. and need to avoid message duplication. You should also consider error-handling scenarios
  and implement mechanisms to prevent infinite loops in case a message repeatedly fails its expiration checks.
