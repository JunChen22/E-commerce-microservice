could run locally or in kubernetes


- change monoith to microservice
- deploy it in docker

- deploy it to kubernete
- change from single to multi vendor e-commerece


admin and search will not be split into smaller yet
just app will be split into 5



I have 5 category for my e-commerece
- product management system
- content management system
- sales management system
- order management system
- user management system

and my e-comemrece site have two part
one is called app which responsible for all the business
and the other part is called admin that similar to app but with more admin specificed feature.

and a search part that is separate from app and admin.

how should I change these 3 from mononith to microservices?

separate them by the 5 category?





so have something like

App (aggreated all the small services)
- product management system service
	- controller/service/connect to database
- content management system service
	- controller/service/connect to database
- sales management system service
	- controller/service/connect to database
- order management system service
	- controller/service/connect to database
- user management system service
	- controller/service/connect to database

Admin (aggreated all the small services) with more function
- product management system service
	- controller/service/connect to database
- content management system service
	- controller/service/connect to database
- sales management system service
	- controller/service/connect to database
- order management system service
	- controller/service/connect to database
- user management system service
	- controller/service/connect to database


Search
- just responsible for search
